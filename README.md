**OVERVIEW**

Since setting up shop in East Africa's biggest economy in 2016, Carrefour has expanded quickly and now runs 13 outlets in the major cities of Nairobi and Mombasa, making it one of the country's biggest foreign supermarket chains, in Kenya.

Carrefour, one of the largest French hypermarket chains in the world was introduced to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) market in 1995 by Majid Al Futtaim, the leading shopping mall, retail and leisure pioneer across MENA. Carrefour has become the most dynamic, fast-moving and exciting hypermarket chain in the region and shared its growth with more than 21,000 employees from more than 68 nationalities in 12 countries, providing shoppers with variety and value-for-money. Carrefour ensures customer satisfaction and everyday convenience while offering unbeatable value for money with a vast array of more than 100,000 products, shoppers can purchase items for their every need, whether home electronics or fresh fruits from around the world, to locally produced items. Carrefour currently operates over 55 hypermarkets and over 50 supermarkets and one web store in 12 countries across the MENA region and will extend to include 38 countries in the Middle East, Central Asia, Africa and Russia. By 2018, Majid Al Futtaim Retail expects to reach 140 hypermarkets and 210 supermarkets and expand its territory in 6 new markets.

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

You are a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and are currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the highest no. of sales (total price including tax). Your project has been divided into four parts where you'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights.

**Part 1: Dimensionality Reduction

This section of the project entails reducing your dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNE algorithm or PCA. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights gained from your analysis.

**Part 2: Feature Selection

This section requires you to perform feature selection through the use of the unsupervised learning methods learned earlier this week. You will be required to perform your analysis and provide insights on the features that contribute the most information to the dataset.

**Part 3: Association Rules

This section will require that you create association rules that will allow you to identify relationships between variables in the dataset. You are provided with a separate dataset that comprises groups of items that will be associated with others. Just like in the other sections, you will also be required to provide insights for your analysis.

**Part 4: Anomaly Detection

You have also been requested to check whether there are any anomalies in the given sales dataset. The objective of this task being fraud detection.
